# Magic DSC

Digital setting circles for astronomical telescopes using ESP32 and two rotary encoders

Inside the "code" folder you will find:
magic_bluetooth.ino - the blue tooth version of the code
magic_wifi.ino - the wifi version of the code
 a utility app used to count the encoders ticks (useful when you don't know the number of teeth on your gear and you just want to count the encoder ticks instead)
